# Summary

The calculator tied a lot of the things I have been learning from past projects together. One thing that stood out when I first started this project was to break down the calculator into different pieces. For each piece, I created a function so that it had one job. That made the project go a lot smoother. 

The most challenging piece was when I got to the part of trying to understand how to go about conducting the operations. The way around that was when I was advised by my mentors to just focus on the end result with hard coded variables at first. In this case, it was the equal sign. Once I got the equal sign to work the way I needed it to, I was able to work backwards from there and remove the 'training wheels' and code in the user's input versus hard coded variables.

With this project, I got the chance to practice more using conditional statements to control what happens in different scenarios throughout the user's experience. Despite some of the challenges, I thought it was a fun project.
